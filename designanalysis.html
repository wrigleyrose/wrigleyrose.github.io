<h1>Design Analysis</h1>
<h2>Contrast - Wrigley Johnson</h2>
    <p>The website www.convertworld.com shows repetition primarily in using color. Blue and yellow/orange are what's known as a triad color scheme, so it works very well when it comes to websites. Using opposite colors in a color scheme make it a lot easier on the ye. Typically I would not like the yellow orange convertworld uses for their site, but paired with the blue it really isn't as bad. They use contrast mostly in their menu with the white font on the mustard background, which I find readable enough on their site. It looks neat and organized, and I think is a good depiction of the contrast principle.</p>

<h1>Proximity - Sara </h1>
    <p>It is possible for the user to see in the photo at the right, that lists are separated by type, which makes easier and faster too look for what kind of conversion.</p>
<h1>Alignment - Sara</h1>
    <p>The whole page is designed as a big list. The several boxes have different kind of measurements but each tool is aligned, making it easier for the user to look for just for the specific object he/she is looking for. There’s no necessity to look for the tool or list. They are clearly shown in the page.</p>

<h1>Repetition - Roopak</h1>
    <p>Principle of repetition simply means the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout your design. Repetition of certain design elements in a slide or among a deck of slides will bring a clear sense of unity, consistency, and cohesiveness. In website http://convertworld.com we can see top heading, design and font and color stays the same all the time no matter what option we click. As well as the menu bar sign stay the same. When we click to convert currency rates, distance, temperature, area, one thing we can notice heading right above the box is says “I want to convert” that’s always stays the same. We can see a consistent use of background color is been repeating mostly color we see in this website is yellow, orange, and black for the text. The consistent use of this one element and these colors served to add a subtle repetitive element that gave his visuals a professional and unified look. We can see each calculator has a two box one to type in your value and another one for the result. These elements in the repetition helps their users to surf the website easily and in a better way and they loose interest because they thing its easier.</p>

<h1>Typography - Kenzie</h1>
    <p>The typography of convertworld.com is very useful. Even the convertworld.com site name that links to the home page, is very appreciative to the eye.

Going further down the site, in inside the home page is a header that reads “Quick conversion”. Now, I cannot immediately tell what that means, so I read further.

In the paragraph below the header, inside are some bold words. With these bold words I can skim read the paragraph and immediately tell right away what the purpose is of this particular website.

Following after the paragraph, there’s a box called “Currency”. Inside is some nice typography that helps guide you through the process of using the box that the website hosts; and the typography has a nice flow to it. If I had to rate the typography of this part of the website...I would give it an eight of ten because I really like the typography, but as you go down further in the website. Well, then the typography gets blended in with a light blue background with navy blue words. Not much to look at, but the very beginning of the site was easier to enjoy and not feel overwhelmed with too many elements.</p>
